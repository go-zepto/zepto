# Quickstart

Zepto is a lightweight framework for the development of microservices & web services in golang.

As an opinionated framework, zepto proposes to have a quick setup and with the greatest needs for the development of modern microservices. But not only that. It is a framework prepared for the development of complete web applications.

See below some of our features:

- gRPC & HTTP support
- Broker: Publish & Subscribe Events
    - Google Pub/Sub
    - Kafka (Comming soon...)
    - RabbitMQ (Comming soon)
- Healthcheck
- Gracefully Shutdown
- Pretty & Plugabble Logger
- Web Module:
    - Routing
    - Template Rendering
    - Debug Mode
    - Cookie
    - Session
    - File Upload
    - Static Files
    - Sass & JS building with webpack (dev and prod)
    - Error Handler
    - Testing Utilities

# A Minimal Application

A minimal Zepto application looks something like this:

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/go-zepto/zepto"
	"github.com/gorilla/mux"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	z := zepto.NewZepto(
		zepto.Name("ms.hello.world"),
		zepto.Version("latest"),
	)

	r := mux.NewRouter()

	r.HandleFunc("/hello", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		_, _ = w.Write([]byte("Hello, World!"))
	})

	// Setup HTTP Server
	z.SetupHTTP("0.0.0.0:8000", r)

	z.Start()
}
```

---

# Instalation

With zepto you can easily create a project with the CLI tool:

```bash
go get -u github.com/go-zepto/zepto-cli/cmd/zepto
```

---

# Create a Project

If you want to create a project, just run this command:

```bash
zepto new <PROJECT_TYPE> github.com/username/project
```

---

Available project types:

- **ms**: It only includes the Zepto core like HTTP, gRPC, Healthcheck, Broker and all the basic structure to start the development and deployment of a microservice

- **web**: It includes the zepto core and also the web module that includes routing, templating, cookie, session, file upload, static files, assets building (webpack).

Examples:
          
```bash
# ms
zepto new ms github.com/username/my-microservice

# web
zepto new web github.com/username/my-web
```



# HTTP & gRPC 

With zepto, you can easily set up an HTTP and/or gRPC server. Both can work simultaneously.

```go
	// Setup gRPC Server
	z.SetupGRPC("0.0.0.0:9000", func(s *grpc.Server) {
		pb.RegisterTodosServer(s, handlers.NewGRPCHandler(svc))
	})

	// Setup HTTP Server
	z.SetupHTTP("0.0.0.0:8000", handlers.NewHTTPHandler(svc))
```

# Broker/PubSub

Publish and Receive messages in an easy way. Zepto abstracts all the encode/decode logic behind sending and receiving messages from your broker.It is also extensible, as it has an interface layer that facilitates the creation of new brokers.

## Broker Setup

```go
// Setup Broker Provider (Google Pub/Sub)
z.SetupBroker(gcp.NewBroker(
    gcp.ProjectID("my-project"),
    gcp.TopicPrefix("dev.accounts."),
))
```

## Subscribe to Messages

```go
z.Broker().Subscribe("created", func(ctx context.Context, user *pb.User) {
    fmt.Println("User created account: " + user.Name)
})
```

## Publish Messages

```go
z.Broker().Publish(ctx, "created", user)
```

# Logging

Zepto uses the [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) library for Logging. It is extensible and customizable. You can define the log format you want, as well as which channel you want to log to. By default, our log looks like the one in the image below:
